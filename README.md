## Introduction
COIN100 (C100) is a decentralized cryptocurrency index fund built on the Polygon network. It represents the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, mirroring the performance of the overall crypto market. Inspired by traditional index funds like the S&P 500, C100 provides a diversified, market-wide exposure to the crypto industry without requiring active portfolio management from investors.

## Problem Statement
The crypto market can be volatile and fragmented. Investors seeking broad exposure face challenges in selecting and maintaining a balanced portfolio of top assets. Without a simple mechanism to track the aggregate performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, investors may either miss growth opportunities or take on unnecessary risk.

## Solution: COIN100 (C100) Token
C100 solves these challenges by:
- Offering a token that represents a proportional share of the top 100 crypto market cap.
- Automatically adjusting each holder’s balance through global rebases as the top 100 market cap changes.
- Reducing complexity for investors who want broad market exposure without active rebalancing.

## Key Principles and Features

### Fairness and Equal Treatment of Holders
Every holder’s balance scales proportionally with changes in the total market cap. No single participant is advantaged or disadvantaged during rebases.

### Global Rebase Mechanism
On each upkeep call, the total supply adjusts to reflect the updated top 100 crypto market cap. All balances scale equally, maintaining each holder’s fractional ownership.

### Manual Upkeep in Initial Phase
Early on, the owner will manually call the rebase function with updated market cap figures. Over time, this process can transition to an automated system (e.g., via a governance proposal and oracle integration).

### No Complex Public Sale Mechanics
At launch, the entire supply is minted to the owner. The owner retains 3% for initial upkeep and distributes 97% through an ICO or directly to a DEX liquidity pool, allowing free market discovery of the token price.

## Tokenomics

### Initial Parameters
- **Initial Supply = Initial Market Cap (M₀)**: If M₀ is the initial top 100 crypto market cap in USD, we set total supply = M₀ C100.
- **Reference Price (~$1/C100)**: By pairing C100 with a stable asset (e.g., USDC) in a liquidity pool, initial market participants can anchor the price around $1.

### Distribution (Owner Allocation & ICO)
- Owner receives 100% at deployment.
- Owner keeps 3% (developer allocation).
- Owner allocates remaining 97% for ICO or liquidity provisioning.

### Rebase Formula ("Genius" Formula)
**ratio = M_new / M_old**  
- New Supply = Old Supply * ratio  
- Every holder’s balance is multiplied by the same ratio.

This ensures fair and transparent tracking of the market cap changes.

### Market Dynamics and Price Stability
If the market cap doubles, all balances double, maintaining the token’s value reference. As the community matures and markets become more efficient, the token price should remain stable around its baseline in response to these proportional adjustments.

## Technical Architecture

### Polygon Network
Deployed on Polygon for low gas fees and high throughput.

### C100 Token Contract
Implements ERC20 standards, rebase logic, ownership control, pause/unpause functionalities, and integration points for future governance.

### ICO (Public Sale) Contract
Handles the initial distribution of 97% tokens. Investors purchase C100 with MATIC or ERC20 tokens (e.g., USDC) during the ICO period. Unsold tokens are burned at the end, ensuring only the circulating supply reflects real participants.

### Scaling and GonsPerFragment
Balances are tracked in a large integer unit called “gons.” The global `gonsPerFragment` variable determines how these translate into user balances. On rebase, adjusting `gonsPerFragment` updates everyone’s balance proportionally in O(1) complexity.

## Governance

### Transition from Owner to Governor
Initially, the owner manages the contract. Later, a governor contract can be introduced. The governor can propose and vote on changes (parameters, treasury usage, etc.), enabling community-driven evolution.

### Future Governor Contract
By deploying a governor contract and timelock controller, the project gradually moves towards full decentralization. Governance token holders can vote on upgrades, new features, or parameter changes (e.g., adjusting the rebase frequency or introducing a treasury fee).

### Community Involvement
Over time, the community will shape the project’s future. They can propose:
- Adjusting parameters (fees, rebase frequency)
- Allocating treasury funds for development, marketing, or liquidity
- Introducing new features or improvements

## Security

### Ownership Controls
The `onlyOwner` and `onlyAdmin` modifiers ensure that only authorized parties (owner or governor) can make critical changes.

### Pause/Unpause Mechanisms
The contract can be paused in emergencies, preventing transfers and safeguarding against exploits during uncertain times.

### Reentrancy Guards
NonReentrant modifiers protect against complex reentrancy attacks, ensuring safe execution of functions like buy tokens or rebase.

### Audits and Best Practices
Smart contract auditing and community code reviews will enhance trust and security. Following industry standards, best practices, and thorough testing before mainnet deployment is crucial.

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1:** Token and ICO launch, manual upkeep.
- **Phase 2:** Introduce governance, set governor contract.
- **Phase 3:** Possibly add oracles for automated updates.
- **Phase 4:** Community-driven proposals for enhancements, treasury usage, fee adjustments.
- **Phase 5:** Ongoing refinement, scaling, and ecosystem expansion.

## ICO Plan (Simplicity-Focused)

### ICO Parameters
- Duration: e.g., 12 months.
- Accepted Currencies: MATIC, optionally USDC.
- Rate: Fixed C100 per MATIC/USDC.

### During the ICO
- Investors buy C100 directly from the crowdsale contract.
- Owner periodically calls rebase to keep C100 supply aligned with the top 100 market cap.
- Unsold tokens remain in the ICO contract, also getting rebased.

### Post-ICO Finalization and Burning Unsold Tokens
At the end of the ICO:
- No more purchases allowed.
- Any unsold tokens are burned, ensuring the supply reflects only actively held tokens plus the owner’s 3%.

### Maintaining the Index Post-ICO
After the ICO:
- Continue daily/periodic rebases.
- Future governance can introduce advanced features (e.g., treasury, automated oracles).
