# COIN100 (C100)
****COIN100** is a decentralized cryptocurrency index fund built on the polygon network. It represents the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, offering users a diversified portfolio that mirrors the performance of the overall crypto market. Inspired by traditional index funds like the S&P 500, COIN100

**Ultimate Goal:** To dynamically track and reflect the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, ensuring that COIN100 remains a relevant and accurate representation of the cryptocurrency market.

review the logic in our numbers 
in other ways .. audit the idea of our new index fund 

review the logic in our numbers 
in other ways .. audit the idea of our new index fund 
we will set the initial price of the coin to 0.001
the supply adjustment 
the amount we mint and burn 
does the numbers make sense ? 
is this goin to be sustainable ? 
how would the price of token be related to market data of token and other Dex activity ?
how would the price change when new coins are added to the index ?
how would the price change when new coins are removed from the index ?
does the price of token depend on the price of the underlying coins ?
and if it it does ... how would the price change when the price of the underlying coins change ?
like if i own $100 worth of C100 tokens ... how would the price change when total market cap to top 100 increase ? wpould that make my holdings less valuable ?
how to sustain the value ? whats fair ? 
does it reflect the idea of index fund tracking total 100 coins in market cap ? 
you'll notice every logical flaw in every number in the code and think of future scenarios on why this might be a good or bad idea or if it just needs modification and then be perfect 
also focus on finding the flaws in the supply rebase mechanism and how it affects the price ... think of the users .. assume 1000 wallets are out there ... think of all the scenarios ... 
and each flaw you provide .. discuss it ... give cons and pros ... how it might be improved .... and suggesst a new approach or a new modification

we need to audit this to be the perfect index fund tracker of all times ... simple way but elegant and accurate



ok 
- minting for public sale and devloper llcoation should happen only once on deployment
- we need a genius formula for the supply and price thats also simple and affective and represent a true index fund tracker and benifit holders as well
- need to come up with a genius approch to minting and burning or maybe rethink it 
- we dont need oracles autoamted logic now ... we can have admin do it for intiial phase ... admin is owner of contract untill we set the governor contract that'll come in the future .. but the intial phase we allow admin functinoality to owner till gov is set ... community will choose that new gov contract later
- we'll do manual upkeep ( if the new genius approach needs upkeep ... you choose) in the intiial phase at least 
- If the price of underlying coins goes up 20%, the top 100 market cap goes up 20%. In a truly index-like mechanism, each holder’s share of the index should reflect this gain, come up with a genius formula for that
- address Sustainability and Fairness Concerns with a new genius formula where all holders scale together ... should be simple and not complex and easy to implement 
- Full Rebase Mechanism for All Holders (please no oracle ... for now manual upkeep for that) , Instead of selectively minting/burning tokens to or from the owner/public sale address, use a global rebase approach ...On each update, if the top 100 mcap has grown by X%, increase everyone’s balance by X%. If it drops by Y%, reduce everyone’s balance by Y% ensuring every holder always represents a stable fraction of the index. The token price might stay around a reference peg (like $1), and the supply changes reflect the index’s performance ... please give real life production ready logic numbers .. no examples here pls
- for marekt cap data ... will still be provided manually till we set a gov
- on launch lets give fixed percentage to owner ... and do we need public sale address. ? people should be able to freely buy this easily ... dont want controlled public sale 


think of all the points .... list the full white paper for this project contract here with all the points discussed ... fully audited plan for the contract .. .full production ready plan with full well thought out numbers, forumals and algorithm and functionalities and features 
make sure everything logically and cohesivly work together to make the project successfull


then after that you'll write the full new code ... the full code for our project should be in one contract
