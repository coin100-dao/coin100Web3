# COIN100 (C100)
****COIN100** is a decentralized cryptocurrency index fund built on the polygon network. It represents the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, offering users a diversified portfolio that mirrors the performance of the overall crypto market. Inspired by traditional index funds like the S&P 500, COIN100

**Ultimate Goal:** To dynamically track and reflect the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, ensuring that COIN100 remains a relevant and accurate representation of the cryptocurrency market.

review the logic in our numbers 
in other ways .. audit the idea of our new index fund 


review the logic in our numbers 
in other ways .. audit the idea of our new index fund 
we will set the initial price of the coin to 0.001
the rewards 
the supply adjustment 
the amount we mint and burn 
does the numbers make sense ? 
is this goin to be sustainable ? 
does it reflect the idea of index fund tracking total 100 coins in market cap ? 
you'll notice every logical flaw in every number in the code and think of future scenarios on why this might be a good or bad idea or if it just needs modification and then be perfect 
also focus on finding the flaws in the supply rebase mechanism and how it affects the price ... think of the users .. assume 1000 wallets are out there ... think of all the scenarios ... 
and each flaw you provide .. discuss it ... give cons and pros ... how it might be improved .... and suggesst a new approach or a new modification
dont forget that we also want the holders to beneift from this project similar to why people by the S&P500 ... they need to make money somehow wither with price apprecaition or reward mechanism ... so think of that as well and suggest 
we need to audit this to be the perfect index fund tracker of all times ... simple way but elegant and accurate


What if we come up with a new approach ? on deployment we pass current market cap and mint that amount and minted or burnt amount is based on new market cap ? 
And this way price of token is related to market data of token and other Dex activity ? 
Lets rethink how much we much we mint and burn to correlate to market cap especially on deployment 
ovreall we need logic to make this the perfect index fund tracker .. the perfect token to track top 100 coins in market cap 
Dont suggest any decentralized data feed right now … at this stage we’ll invoke upkeep manually till we set decentralized governor 
And also lets rethink how much we mint on deployment …
and lets rethink if the actual price of token to usd needs to be in the equation …
Current total market cap of top 100 coins in usd should be passed in initial deployment and should be the amount to mint 
current total market cap of top 100 coins is 3,657,372,535,773
Developer still gets an amount which is 3% …. And not target price should be in equation … remove it 
Again as initial phase the upkeep is manual 
so dont write the full code yet ... i just want you to give me a new modified plan for tokenomics  completely vetting the process
After full review and vetting and issue finding and solution suggestion (dont make it complex ) give me a full plan with a genius formula for everything 
Full cohesive comprehensive well thought out plann
Need the most dynamic contract even audited for the perfect formula 





where ever there is a change in numbers .. tell me where to add it and what are the numbers 
if a new variable or function .. give me full logic of it with commetns and where to place it 
if changes in a function ... give me function's full new code with comments .... no place holder logic or example numbers please ... need full production ready modifications 

again when you give me code ... if its global give me the code snippet ... if its in a function give me the full code for that functon withe the suggested changes and comments so its easy to copy and paste 
and finally after everything guide me to remove what needs to be removed
