idea of contract
**COIN100** is a decentralized cryptocurrency index fund built on the polygon network. It represents the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, offering users a diversified portfolio that mirrors the performance of the overall crypto market. Inspired by traditional index funds like the S\&P 500, COIN100

**Ultimate Goal:** To dynamically track and reflect the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, ensuring that COIN100 remains a relevant and accurate representation of the cryptocurrency market.

want to create this token to track top 100 coin mareket cap and its price should reflect so
we need a mechanism to which this will work like magic 
we need 5% to developer wallet and 5% to liquidity wallet 
and 3% fees on transactions (1% for dev and 1 for liquidity and 1 to burn )

now we want the start price to be 0.01 
but we need tokenomics 
what tokonomics do we need ? 
the price of this should grow as new buyers buy the token and price should be adjusted hourly based on total market cap for top 100 coin
we should think of adjusting the price without spending money ( we could use chainlink functions and automations)
but most importantly we need robust tokonmics to bring money to the dev team and project and holders 
While taking in account total market cap for top 100 and holders of the coin
current market cap of top 100 coins market cap is 3.8 Trillion
need to start really small and go up and appreacate but also keep tracking the topp 100 coins
this should be a good service similar to any index tracker stock

lets focus on how token holders could make money over time ... like price should appreciate not just becouse more holders are there
but also market cap changes ? not sure ... need a genius mathamitcal solution


what tokenomics do we need ? give me a solid plan
make sure everyone makes money .... this should be robust and production ready 
give me the full algorithm without giving me the code 
need full plan and justify with math and numbers how people will make money 

remember .. we dont have money to back our token with assets .. we want to appreciate more the more people buy it and start it's price at 0.01 
give me all possible scenarios that could happen , be realistic with your numbers ... like i'd like to know all scenarios from price low to when it grows 

we need a solid contract but nothing too complicated but with all the things i requested before 
solid contract with chain link automation, a chainlink function that runs on schedule interacts with contract and requestMarketCapData via coingecko 
make sure the token value grows , what i mean make sure the algorithm knows that and  calculates it 
come up with a genius Tokenomics structer and price adjustment mechanism and write full code after all the plan you'll layout .. full .sol code for Coin100 (C100) token
need a smart price adjustment mechainsim wither its burning or somthing else doest matter .. need full code ... dont give me examples or directions in code .. come up with solutions and implement them 
price adjustment based on total marekt cap on top 100 from coingecko could be 
"async function run(request) {",
                "  const response = await fetch('https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=100&page=1');",
                "  const data = await response.json();",
                "  let totalMarketCap = 0;",
                "  for (const coin of data) {",
                "    totalMarketCap += coin.market_cap;",
                "  }",
                "  return totalMarketCap.toString();",
                "}"


keep in mind we're starting with no asset backing ... i will be buying the token after it's minted and ready for public sale and i'll buy with like $50 only ....
